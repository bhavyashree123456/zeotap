# Customer Segmentation Clustering Report
# Objective:
   The goal of this analysis is to perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques based on both profile and transaction data.
  The insights will allow for grouping customers into meaningful segments based on their behavior and characteristics.
# Methodology:
  1. Data Preprocessing: 
     * Two datasets (Customers.csv and Transactions.csv) were merged on CustomerID.
     * Transaction features such as Total Spend, Transaction Count, and Recency (days since last transaction) were computed.
  2. Feature Scaling:
     * The features were standardized using StandardScaler to ensure proper scaling for clustering algorithms.
  3. Clustering Algorithm:
     * K-Means Clustering was used for segmenting customers.
     * The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method.
  4. Evaluation Metrics:
     *  Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI): A measure of cluster compactness and separation.
     * Silhouette Score: A metric assessing how similar objects are within a cluster compared to other clusters.
  5. Visualization:
     * Elbow Curve: To identify the optimal number of clusters.
     * Cluster Scatter Plot: To visualize clusters in feature space.
# Results
   1. Optimal Number of Clusters:
     * Based on the Elbow Method (see below), the optimal number of clusters was determined to be 4.
   2. Cluster Metrics:
     * Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.72 (Lower values indicate better clustering.)
     * Silhouette Score: 0.63 (Higher values indicate better-defined clusters.)
   3. Cluster Characteristics:
     *  Customers were segmented into 4 clusters based on their Total Spend and Transaction Count.
     * The scatter plot below highlights the clustering results:
# Key Observations:
     * Cluster 0 (Purple): Represents high-frequency but moderate-spending customers.
     * Cluster 1 (Blue): Represents high-spending and frequent customers.
     * Cluster 2 (Teal): Represents low-spending and less frequent customers.
     *  Cluster 3 (Yellow): Represents moderate-spending and frequent customers.
